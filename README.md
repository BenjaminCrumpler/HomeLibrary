# HomeLibrary

So Libib (Libbib.com) has a neat system that lets you record books and other items in your home library. And will pull information based on its ISBN. However, it wont automatically sort it for you according to any traditional libary Scheme. 

Over at OpenLibary they have a huge repository of books. And it includes the dewey decimal system and other organizing principles.
The goal of this repository is to aid in getting these two to interact with each other.
